README

Sideways Dungeon is a text adventure puzzle game developed by Kevyn Thompson. It is coded entirely from the
ground-up with Java. The purpose of this project (besides a fun hobby) is to challenge myself to get exposure
to and become familiar with programming topics not discussed in school. By working on this project, I have
learned how to form good programming habits, how to work with a professional IDE, how to perform important
development functions like package management, and more. Feel free to browse through the files and make fun
of my rookie programming mistakes. :)


HOW TO PLAY

-~PRISON CELL~-		<-- The room you are currently in

--??---
|     |
|  o  #		<-- Map
|     |
-------

----------- ~{ LEGEND }~ -----------
o : You        u : Useable
| / - : Wall   t : Takeable				<-- Legend
|| / = : Path  a : Talkable
# : Blocked    ? : Item of Interest

Exits: [north]		<-- Currently available exits

It's the prison cell you woke up in. It's too dark to see
anything, but you can barely make out what looks like a small
bed in the corner, and some kind of markings on the walls. An		<-- Description
ominous light is cast into the cell from a torch in the next
room.

What would you like to do: 			<-- Command prompt


For each room, you are shown what room you are in, the map, possible exits, a short description of the room,
and the command prompt. The command prompt is where you enter what action you would like to do; for instance,
inspect, use, take, etc. If available, you can also type a direction to move to another room. The focus of
the game is exploration and puzzles, with a semi-linear path for the player to take. The goal is to make it
to the end of the game and escape the dungeon.

TIP: If you are unsure of what command to use, you can type "help" at the command prompt to see a list of
commands.


NOTE

The game is a work in progress and currently unfinished. Players can play up until the point where they must
find three portraits (currently, up to two can be found).
